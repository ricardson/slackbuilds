Farbfeld is a lossless image-format designed to be parsed and piped easily. 
It is probably the simplest image-format you can find (see FORMAT).
It does not have integrated compression, but allows compression algorithms to work 
with it easily by adding little entropy to the image data itself. This beats PNG in many cases.
Given the free choice of compression algorithms, it is trivial to switch to better and faster ones as they
show up in the future.
